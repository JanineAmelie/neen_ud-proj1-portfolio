**Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree Proj 1**
Build a Portfolio Site
---

###Project Overview
A design mockup was provided to me as a PDF file. My task was to recreate the layout in HTML/CSS responsively using a CSS framework of my choosing.

 The overall 'aesthetic' design of the page could be customized but the layout was followed but improved upon slightly to look better responsively.
